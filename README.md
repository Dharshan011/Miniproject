## Title of the Project
LIVER TUMOR SEGMENTATION â€“ RESNET 50 



## About
Liver tumor segmentation is a crucial task in medical imaging that assists radiologists in diagnosing and treating liver cancer. By accurately identifying and delineating tumors within liver images (e.g., CT or MRI scans), healthcare professionals can make better-informed decisions. This project utilizes the ResNet-50 architecture, a deep convolutional neural network known for its effectiveness in image classification and segmentation tasks, to automate and enhance the segmentation process.

## Features
Deep Learning Architecture: Utilizes ResNet-50, which incorporates residual learning to improve training efficiency and model performance.
Data Augmentation: Implements techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve model generalization.
Segmentation Accuracy: Aims for high accuracy in identifying tumor boundaries, reducing false positives and negatives.
Visualization Tools: Provides tools for visualizing segmentation results and model predictions, enhancing interpretability.
Cross-Validation: Employs k-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness and reliability of the model performance.
User-Friendly Interface: Offers an interface for healthcare professionals to upload images and receive segmentation results easily.

## Requirements
Hardware:
GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GTX/RTX series) for accelerated training.
Sufficient RAM (16 GB or more recommended).
Software:
Python (3.6 or later)
Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
Dataset:
A labeled dataset of liver images with annotated tumor regions (e.g., LiTS dataset).
